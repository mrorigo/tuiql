## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** Performance issues with large datasets.
  - **Mitigation:** Implement strict streaming and pagination policies.

- **Risk:** Terminal compatibility across platforms.
  - **Mitigation:** Use `crossterm` and maintain a thorough CI matrix.

- **Risk:** SQLite extension availability differences.
  - **Mitigation:** Detect features dynamically and degrade gracefully.
