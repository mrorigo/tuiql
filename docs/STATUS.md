## Upcoming Priorities

1. **Schema Navigator:**
   - Implement a tree-based schema navigator with badges for row counts, PK/FK indicators, and index details. ✅ Completed
2. **Schema Map:**
   - Parse real schema data to generate a map.
   - Visualize relationships between tables using ASCII diagrams.

3. **Results Grid:**
   - Add support for inline JSON tree views and type-aware cell rendering.
   - Implement virtualized scrolling for large datasets.
   - Enhance rendering logic to display rows within the viewport.

4. **Query Editor:**
   - Add linting for dangerous SQL operations.
   - Implement query formatting for better readability.

4. **Plan Visualizer:**
   - Highlight index usage and optimize the cost/loop visualization.

4. **Testing:**
   - Expand property-based tests for schema diff and query execution.

5. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Benchmark and optimize for large databases and result sets.

6. **Documentation:**
   - Update user and developer documentation to reflect new features.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** Performance issues with large datasets.
  - **Mitigation:** Implement strict streaming and pagination policies.

- **Risk:** Terminal compatibility across platforms.
  - **Mitigation:** Use `crossterm` and maintain a thorough CI matrix.

- **Risk:** SQLite extension availability differences.
  - **Mitigation:** Detect features dynamically and degrade gracefully.
