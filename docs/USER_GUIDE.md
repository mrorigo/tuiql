- Use `:ro` to enable read-only mode (prevents accidental modifications)
- Use `:rw` to enable read-write mode (required for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
- Use `:begin`, `:commit`, and `:rollback` to manage transactions

### Schema Exploration

TUIQL provides powerful tools for understanding your database structure:

#### Schema Overview
```sql
:tables   -- Show all tables with row counts and basic schema info
```

#### Entity-Relationship Diagrams
```sql
:erd      -- Generate comprehensive ER diagram with relationships
```
The ER diagram shows:
- üìã All tables with their columns and types
- üîë Primary key indicators
- üîó Foreign key relationships showing parent-child connections
- ‚ÜôÔ∏è Reference counters showing how many tables reference each one
- üìù Column type information
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Circular reference warnings

### Full-Text Search (FTS5)

TUIQL includes comprehensive support for SQLite's FTS5 (Full-Text Search version 5) for natural language searching:

#### Getting Started with FTS5
```sql
-- First, explore the database and see what FTS5 tables exist
:fts5 list

-- Get help with usage examples
:fts5 help
```

#### Creating FTS5 Tables
```sql
-- Create a simple FTS5 table
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE posts_fts USING fts5(title, content);

-- Create with custom tokenizer
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE docs_fts USING fts5(title, body, tokenize=porter);

-- Index from existing table
INSERT INTO posts_fts SELECT id, title, content FROM posts WHERE content IS NOT NULL;
```

#### Searching with FTS5
```sql
-- Basic phrase search
SELECT * FROM posts_fts WHERE posts_fts MATCH 'database optimization';

-- Proximity search (words within 10 terms of each other)
SELECT * FROM posts_fts WHERE posts_fts MATCH 'database NEAR optimization';

-- Boolean operators
SELECT * FROM posts_fts WHERE posts_fts MATCH 'database OR mysql';
SELECT * FROM posts_fts WHERE posts_fts MATCH 'database AND NOT tutorial';

-- Ranked results (higher rank = better match)
SELECT title, rank FROM posts_fts WHERE posts_fts MATCH 'database' ORDER BY rank DESC;

-- Search with highlighting
SELECT highlight(posts_fts, 0, '<b>', '</b>') as highlighted_title
FROM posts_fts WHERE posts_fts MATCH 'database';
```

#### Advanced FTS5 Features
- **Tokenizers**: `porter` (stemming), `unicode61`, `trigram` (character-level)
- **Ranking**: BM25 algorithm for relevance scoring
- **Highlighting**: Mark search term occurrences in results
- **Phrase Queries**: Exact phrase matching with quotes
- **Prefix Search**: `*` wildcard for prefix matching
- **Boolean Logic**: AND, OR, NOT, AND_NOT operators

### Attaching Databases

You can attach additional databases using the `:attach` command (coming soon):
```sql
:attach my_other_db path/to/other.db
```
Overlay the attached database onto the primary database, allowing cross-database queries and references.
## Extensibility

### Plugin System

TUIQL supports a flexible plugin system that allows you to extend its functionality with external tools and scripts. Plugins are executable programs that can be easily integrated into your workflow through the `:plugin` command.

#### Setting Up Plugins

To use plugins, first configure them in your TUIQL configuration file:

```toml
[plugins]
enabled = [
  { name = "data_exporter", path = "/usr/local/bin/export.sh", description = "Export data in custom format" },
  { name = "backup_tool", path = "~/scripts/backup.py", description = "Create database backups" }
]
```

Each plugin is defined with:
- `name`: Short name used to invoke the plugin
- `path`: Path to the executable script or program
- `description`: Optional description shown in help

#### Using Plugins

Once configured, invoke plugins using the `:plugin` command:

```sql
:plugin data_exporter csv users
:plugin backup_tool --path /backup/location
```

#### Plugin Requirements

For a script to work as a TUIQL plugin:

1. **Executable**: The file must be executable (`chmod +x /path/to/plugin`)
2. **Path Resolution**: Use absolute paths or `~` for home directory
3. **Arguments**: Plugins receive command-line arguments as provided
4. **Output**: Plugin output is displayed in the TUIQL interface
5. **Exit Codes**: Non-zero exit codes are treated as errors

#### Example Plugin Script

Here's a simple bash plugin example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Export plugin that takes table name and format as arguments

TABLE_NAME=$1
FORMAT=$2

echo "Exporting table $TABLE_NAME in $FORMAT format..."

# Export logic here...
echo "Export completed!"
```


## Tips and Best Practices

### General Usage
1. **Always check connection status**: After opening a database, verify that the connection was successful.
2. **Use read-only mode**: When you only need to query data, use `:ro` to prevent accidental modifications.
3. **Command history**: Use the ‚Üë/‚Üì arrow keys to navigate through previous commands.
4. **Reverse history search**: Press Ctrl+R to search through your command history interactively.
5. **Tab completion**: SQL queries support intelligent completion - press Tab for contextual suggestions (keywords, table names, column names).
6. **Persistent sessions**: Your command history and performance metrics are automatically saved to `~/.tuiql/` and persist between sessions.

### Schema Exploration
1. **Start with schema overview**: Use `:tables` to get a quick understanding of your database structure.
2. **Explore relationships**: Use `:erd` to understand how tables connect via foreign keys.
3. **Use FTS5 for text content**: Set up full-text search for efficient content queries.

### Query Development
1. **Analyze performance**: Use `:plan` followed by a SQL query to see execution details.
2. **Leverage FTS5**: For text-heavy applications, FTS5 can dramatically improve search performance.
3. **Consider tokenizers**: Choose appropriate tokenizers (porter for stemming, trigram for Asian languages).

### Advanced Tips
1. **FTS5 ranking**: Use rank in ORDER BY clauses for better search result ordering.
2. **FTS5 highlighting**: Use highlight() function to show search term relevance in results.
3. **ER diagram insights**: Pay attention to tables with no relationships (isolated data) or circular references.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Failed**
   - Verify the database path is correct
   - Check file permissions
   - Ensure the file is a valid SQLite database

2. **Permission Denied**
   - Check file system permissions
   - Try running in read-only mode (`:ro`)

3. **Database is Locked**
   - Check if another process is using the database
   - Verify the database file isn't open in another application

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Use `:help` to see available commands
2. Check the error messages for specific details
3. Consult the project's GitHub issues
4. Report new issues with detailed reproduction steps

## Configuration

TUIQL supports user configuration via a TOML file located in the XDG Base Directory specification path (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tuiql/config.toml`, typically `~/.config/tuiql/config.toml`). If no configuration file exists, TUIQL automatically creates one with sensible defaults.

### Configuration Sections

The configuration file supports the following sections:

```toml
[ui]
theme = "dark"              # Interface theme (currently unused, future feature)
show_status_tips = true     # Show status line tips (currently unused, future feature)

[keys]
run = "F5"                  # Key binding for running queries (currently unused, future feature)
run_selection = "S-F5"      # Key binding for running selection (currently unused, future feature)
vim_mode = true             # Enable Vim-style key bindings (currently unused, future feature)

[sqlite]
load_extensions = []        # List of SQLite extensions to load on startup (currently unused, future feature)
page_size_hint = 4096       # Page size hint for SQLite connections (currently unused, future feature)

[plugins]
enabled = [
  { name = "my_plugin", path = "/path/to/plugin", description = "My custom plugin" },
  { name = "another_plugin", path = "~/scripts/another.sh", description = "Another plugin" }
]
```

### Editing Configuration

1. **Manual Editing**: Edit `~/.config/tuiql/config.toml` directly with your preferred text editor
2. **Automatic Creation**: If the file doesn't exist, TUIQL will create it with default values on first startup
3. **Runtime Update**: Currently changes require restarting TUIQL (this will be improved in future versions)

Stay tuned for ongoing development updates! New features are being added regularly.
