## Getting Started

### Installation

TUIQL requires Rust and SQLite to be installed on your system. To install TUIQL:

1. Ensure you have Rust installed (via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
2. Clone the repository
3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
4. The binary will be available at `./target/release/tuiql`

### First Run

You can start TUIQL in two ways:

1. With a database path:
   ```bash
   tuiql path/to/database.db
   ```

2. In interactive mode:
   ```bash
   tuiql
   ```

## Basic Usage

### Reedline Interface Features

TUIQL uses a professional reedline-powered interface with advanced editing capabilities:

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Ctrl+R**: Reverse search through command history
- **Tab**: Intelligent SQL auto-completion (keywords, tables, columns)
- **‚Üë/‚Üì**: Navigate through command history
- **‚Üí/‚Üê/Home/End**: Standard line editing navigation
- **Ctrl+D**: Exit TUIQL (or type `:quit`)

#### Persistent History
TUIQL automatically maintains command history in `~/.tuiql/repl_history.txt`:
- History persists between sessions
- Search through your command history with Ctrl+R
- Automatic storage of successful and failed queries
- Performance metrics tracked for each query

### Connecting to a Database

There are two ways to connect to a database:

1. **Command Line**: Launch TUIQL with the database path as an argument:
   ```bash
   tuiql path/to/database.db
   ```

2. **REPL Command**: Use the `:open` command in interactive mode:
   ```sql
   :open path/to/database.db
   ```

If the connection is successful, you'll see a confirmation message.

### Viewing Help

To see all available commands and their descriptions, use the `:help` command:
```sql
:help
```

## Working with Databases

### Database Modes

TUIQL supports both read-only and read-write modes:

- Use `:ro` to enable read-only mode (prevents accidental modifications)
- Use `:rw` to enable read-write mode (required for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
- Use `:begin`, `:commit`, and `:rollback` to manage transactions

### Schema Exploration

TUIQL provides powerful tools for understanding your database structure:

#### Schema Overview
```sql
:tables   -- Show all tables with row counts and basic schema info
```

#### Entity-Relationship Diagrams
```sql
:erd      -- Generate comprehensive ER diagram with relationships
```
The ER diagram shows:
- üìã All tables with their columns and types
- üîë Primary key indicators
- üîó Foreign key relationships showing parent-child connections
- ‚ÜôÔ∏è Reference counters showing how many tables reference each one
- üìù Column type information
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Circular reference warnings

### Full-Text Search (FTS5)

TUIQL includes comprehensive support for SQLite's FTS5 (Full-Text Search version 5) for natural language searching:

#### Getting Started with FTS5
```sql
-- First, explore the database and see what FTS5 tables exist
:fts5 list

-- Get help with usage examples
:fts5 help
```

#### Creating FTS5 Tables
```sql
-- Create a simple FTS5 table
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE posts_fts USING fts5(title, content);

-- Create with custom tokenizer
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE docs_fts USING fts5(title, body, tokenize=porter);

-- Index from existing table
INSERT INTO posts_fts SELECT id, title, content FROM posts WHERE content IS NOT NULL;
```

#### Searching with FTS5
```sql
-- Basic phrase search
SELECT * FROM posts_fts WHERE posts_fts MATCH 'database optimization';

-- Proximity search (words within 10 terms of each other)
SELECT * FROM posts_fts WHERE posts_fts MATCH 'database NEAR optimization';

-- Boolean operators
SELECT * FROM posts_fts WHERE posts_fts MATCH 'database OR mysql';
SELECT * FROM posts_fts WHERE posts_fts MATCH 'database AND NOT tutorial';

-- Ranked results (higher rank = better match)
SELECT title, rank FROM posts_fts WHERE posts_fts MATCH 'database' ORDER BY rank DESC;

-- Search with highlighting
SELECT highlight(posts_fts, 0, '<b>', '</b>') as highlighted_title
FROM posts_fts WHERE posts_fts MATCH 'database';
```

#### Advanced FTS5 Features
- **Tokenizers**: `porter` (stemming), `unicode61`, `trigram` (character-level)
- **Ranking**: BM25 algorithm for relevance scoring
- **Highlighting**: Mark search term occurrences in results
- **Phrase Queries**: Exact phrase matching with quotes
- **Prefix Search**: `*` wildcard for prefix matching
- **Boolean Logic**: AND, OR, NOT, AND_NOT operators

### Attaching Databases

You can attach additional databases using the `:attach` command (coming soon):
```sql
:attach my_other_db path/to/other.db
```
Overlay the attached database onto the primary database, allowing cross-database queries and references.

## Tips and Best Practices

### General Usage
1. **Always check connection status**: After opening a database, verify that the connection was successful.
2. **Use read-only mode**: When you only need to query data, use `:ro` to prevent accidental modifications.
3. **Command history**: Use the ‚Üë/‚Üì arrow keys to navigate through previous commands.
4. **Reverse history search**: Press Ctrl+R to search through your command history interactively.
5. **Tab completion**: SQL queries support intelligent completion - press Tab for contextual suggestions (keywords, table names, column names).
6. **Persistent sessions**: Your command history and performance metrics are automatically saved to `~/.tuiql/` and persist between sessions.

### Schema Exploration
1. **Start with schema overview**: Use `:tables` to get a quick understanding of your database structure.
2. **Explore relationships**: Use `:erd` to understand how tables connect via foreign keys.
3. **Use FTS5 for text content**: Set up full-text search for efficient content queries.

### Query Development
1. **Analyze performance**: Use `:plan` followed by a SQL query to see execution details.
2. **Leverage FTS5**: For text-heavy applications, FTS5 can dramatically improve search performance.
3. **Consider tokenizers**: Choose appropriate tokenizers (porter for stemming, trigram for Asian languages).

### Advanced Tips
1. **FTS5 ranking**: Use rank in ORDER BY clauses for better search result ordering.
2. **FTS5 highlighting**: Use highlight() function to show search term relevance in results.
3. **ER diagram insights**: Pay attention to tables with no relationships (isolated data) or circular references.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Failed**
   - Verify the database path is correct
   - Check file permissions
   - Ensure the file is a valid SQLite database

2. **Permission Denied**
   - Check file system permissions
   - Try running in read-only mode (`:ro`)

3. **Database is Locked**
   - Check if another process is using the database
   - Verify the database file isn't open in another application

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Use `:help` to see available commands
2. Check the error messages for specific details
3. Consult the project's GitHub issues
4. Report new issues with detailed reproduction steps
