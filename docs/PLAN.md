# Project Plan

This document outlines the strategy and high-level plan for the TUIQL project. It serves as a roadmap to guide development, testing, and deployment processes.

## Objectives

- Define clear milestones and deliverables.
- Establish a robust development workflow with continuous integration.
- Develop a scalable architecture using idiomatic Rust.
- Implement thorough testing for every component.

## Milestones

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Repository setup and basic documentation.
   - Establish initial directory structure.
   - Create minimal viable product (MVP) plan.

2. **Core Features Development**
   - Define core modules and functionalities.
   - Develop key features in a modular and test-driven manner.
   - Implement continuous integration and testing.

3. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
   - Write comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and system tests.
   - Setup automated testing pipelines.
   - Perform regular code reviews and refactoring.

4. **Deployment & Documentation**
   - Finalize deployment strategies.
   - Complete user and developer documentation.
   - Plan for iterative feedback and improvements.

## Work Process

- **Planning & Tracking:** 
  - Keep track of progress using this document and update regularly.
  - Decompose features into smaller, manageable tasks.

- **Development:** 
  - Use idiomatic Rust with an emphasis on safety, efficiency, and clarity.
  - Follow best practices for code structure and modularity.
  - Commit changes frequently with clear commit messages as per conventional commits.

- **Testing:** 
  - Write tests for every module to ensure functionality and maintainability.
  - Integrate automated tests to run on every commit.

- **Collaboration:**
  - Maintain clear documentation for onboarding new developers.
  - Use code reviews as an opportunity to learn and improve code quality.

## Immediate Next Steps

- Finalize core feature list and architecture.
- Set up initial project scaffolding with tests. [COMPLETED: Cargo.toml and basic main.rs with logging and tests are in place]
- Create a minimal viable version (MVP) to demonstrate key functionalities.
- Document conventional commit messages and development guidelines.
- [Iteration 1] Add CLI stub and SQLite connection stub.
- [Iteration 2] Implement REPL stub, SQL execution stub, plan visualization stub, configuration loader, diff, and schema map stubs.

This plan will evolve as the project grows. Continuous improvements and adaptations will be made to meet the project's objectives and timelines.
