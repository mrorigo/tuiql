# Project Plan

This document outlines the strategy and high-level plan for the TUIQL project. It serves as a roadmap to guide development, testing, and deployment processes.

## Objectives

- Define clear milestones and deliverables.
- Establish a robust development workflow with continuous integration.
- Develop a scalable architecture using idiomatic Rust.
- Implement thorough testing for every component.

## Milestones

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Repository setup and basic documentation.
   - Establish initial directory structure.
   - Create minimal viable product (MVP) plan.

2. **Core Features Development**
   - Define core modules and functionalities.
   - Develop key features in a modular and test-driven manner.
   - Implement continuous integration and testing.

3. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
   - Write comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and system tests.
   - Setup automated testing pipelines.
   - Perform regular code reviews and refactoring.

4. **Deployment & Documentation**
   - Finalize deployment strategies.
   - Complete user and developer documentation.
   - Plan for iterative feedback and improvements.

## Work Process

- **Planning & Tracking:** 
  - Keep track of progress using this document and update regularly.
  - Decompose features into smaller, manageable tasks.

- **Development:** 
  - Use idiomatic Rust with an emphasis on safety, efficiency, and clarity.
  - Follow best practices for code structure and modularity.
  - Commit changes frequently with clear commit messages as per conventional commits.

- **Testing:** 
  - Write tests for every module to ensure functionality and maintainability.
  - Integrate automated tests to run on every commit.

- **Collaboration:**
  - Maintain clear documentation for onboarding new developers.
  - Use code reviews as an opportunity to learn and improve code quality.

## Immediate Next Steps

- Finalize core feature list and architecture.
- Set up initial project scaffolding with tests. [COMPLETED: Cargo.toml and basic main.rs with logging and tests are in place]
- Create a minimal viable version (MVP) to demonstrate key functionalities.
- Document conventional commit messages and development guidelines.
- [Iteration 1] Add CLI stub and SQLite connection stub.
- [Iteration 2] Implement REPL stub, SQL execution stub, plan visualization stub, configuration loader, diff, and schema map stubs. [COMPLETED: Basic schema map rendering implemented]
- [Iteration 3] Add record inspector stub for view and edit records. [COMPLETED: Validation logic enhanced, tests written and passed]
- [Iteration 4] Add command palette stub for quick command execution and integrate tests. [COMPLETED]
- [Iteration 5] Add a help feature to provide users with a list of available commands and their descriptions. [COMPLETED]
- [Iteration 5] Enhance Query Editor with advanced linting for dangerous SQL operations and improved query formatting. [COMPLETED]
- [Iteration 6] Enhance Results Grid with virtualized scrolling, sticky headers, and export options. [COMPLETED]
- [Iteration 7] Add a help feature to provide users with a list of available commands and their descriptions.
- [Iteration 8] Implement command auto-completion in the REPL for better usability.
- [Iteration 9] Add a configuration file loader to allow users to customize keybindings and default settings.
- [Iteration 5] Enhance schema map with grouping, highlighting relationships, and advanced visualization. [COMPLETED]

This plan will evolve as the project grows. Continuous improvements and adaptations will be made to meet the project's objectives and timelines.
