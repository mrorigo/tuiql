# Project Plan

This document outlines the strategy and high-level plan for the TUIQL project. It serves as a roadmap to guide development, testing, and deployment processes.

## Objectives

- Create a blazing-fast, terminal-native SQLite client âœ…
- Focus on schema comprehension, data navigation, and query iteration ðŸš§
- Achieve < 2s time-to-first-result on commodity laptops âœ…
- Maintain 90% keyboard accessibility with median 3 keystrokes to execute last query ðŸš§
- Ensure < 10ms TUI frame budget with 30+ FPS on 100k row scrolling ðŸš§
- Achieve P99 zero panics across 10k sessions ðŸš§

## Architecture

```

  app/                 # main binary, arg parsing, config
  core/                # domain: catalog cache, query exec, diff, plan
  tui/                 # ratatui widgets, layout, theming
  repl/                # reedline integration, command palette
  sql/                 # sqlparser wrappers, formatting, lint rules
  storage/             # exports, history, snippets, keybindings
  drivers/sqlite/      # rusqlite wrapper, pragmas, vtab helpers
  plugins/             # extension points & dynamic registration
```

## Development Process

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Core components (catalog, plan tree, diff engine)
- **Golden Tests**: Widget render snapshots with ratatui harness
- **Integration Tests**: Sample database operations
- **Property Tests**: DDL operations (diff â†’ apply â†’ compare)
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark against 1M row/100 table datasets

### Development Guidelines
- Use idiomatic Rust with focus on safety and performance
- Write tests for all new code and modified existing code
- Follow conventional commit format
- Document all public APIs and user-facing features
- Benchmark performance-critical code paths

### Safety & Performance
- Auto-open databases in autocommit mode
- Implement safe edit mode with WHERE clause guards
- Support read-only mode per connection
- Use virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Implement cancellable long-running queries

## Current Sprint Tasks

### In Progress
- Implement transaction management (BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK)
- Add auto-completion for SQL queries
- Design and implement record inspector
- Add export functionality

### Next Up
- FTS5 helper implementation - SQLite full-text search capabilities
- JSON1 helper implementation - Built-in JSON functions for SQLite
- Database diff functionality - Schema comparison between databases
- Cancellable query support - Interrupting long-running queries
- Configuration system - User preferences and persistent settings
- Property tests for DDL operations - Robust DDL testing framework

### Completed

- [x] Project structure and architecture
- [x] SQLite connection handling
- [x] Basic REPL implementation
- [x] Command parsing and execution
- [x] Help command system
- [x] SQL query execution and result display
- [x] Core functionality tests
- [x] SQL Query Auto-Completion System Implementation
