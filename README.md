production.db> :quit
🙋‍♂️ Session complete. Command history saved to ~/.tuiql/
Query metrics: 12 successful, 0 failed | Total time: 2.4s
Enter a SQL query to visualize its execution plan:
query> SELECT u.name, COUNT(p.id) FROM users u JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id WHERE p.created_at > '2023-01-01' GROUP BY u.id;

=== Query Plan Analysis ===
Plan Execution Steps:
├── SCAN TABLE users AS u using index idx_users_created_timestamp
├── SCAN TABLE posts AS p using index idx_posts_user_created
├── OUTER LOOP JOIN joining on u.id = p.user_id
└── GROUP BY u.id with count aggregation

Index Usage: EXCELLENT - All tables using optimal indexes
