# TUIQL: A Terminal-Native SQLite Client

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Project Status**: Early Development - Core features are being implemented

TUIQL is a blazing-fast, terminal-native, keyboard-centric SQLite client designed to make **schema comprehension**, **data navigation**, and **query iteration** effortless. It combines the speed of the `sqlite3` CLI with a delightful, discoverable TUI that scales from quick one-offs to day-long analysis sessions. Focus on writing SQL, not fighting with your tools.

## Usage

### Opening a Database
```bash
# Open directly with a database path
tuiql path/to/database.db

# Or start in interactive mode and connect later
tuiql
> :open path/to/database.db
```

### Available Commands
Core commands:
- `:help` - List all available commands and their descriptions
- `:open <path>` - Open a database
- `:attach <n> <path>` - Attach another database
- `:tables` - Show database schema information

Transaction management:
- `:begin` - Start a new transaction
- `:commit` - Commit current transaction
- `:rollback` - Rollback current transaction

Database settings:
- `:ro` - Toggle read-only mode
- `:rw` - Toggle read-write mode
- `:pragma <name> [value]` - View or set pragma values

Navigation:
- `:hist` - Show command/query history
- `:quit` - Exit the application

More commands and keybindings will be added as features are implemented.
